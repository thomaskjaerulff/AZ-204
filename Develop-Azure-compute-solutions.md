### Manage container images in Azure Container Registry

Azure Container Registry (ACR) is a managed, private Docker registry service based on the open-source Docker Registry 2.0. Create and maintain Azure container registries to store and manage your private Docker container images.

Azure Container Registry has the following service tier: 

|Tier|Description|
|-|-|
|**Basic**|Cost-optimized|
|**Standard**|Same capabilities as Basic with increased storage and throughput|
|**Premium**|Provide the highest amount of included storage and concurrent operations|

Can include both Windows and Linux images. 

Use Azure Container Registry Tasks (ACR Tasks) to streamline building, testing, pushing, and deploying images in Azure.
